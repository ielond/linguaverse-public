# Content Pipeline Overview

LinguaVerseSchool is built around a content pipeline designed to turn short, level-appropriate stories into **readable, listenable learning units**.

This document describes the pipeline at a high level. It focuses on *what* happens and *why*, not on internal tooling or implementation details.

---

## From story idea to learning content

Each LinguaVerseSchool story moves through a series of stages. The aim is to preserve consistency, quality, and alignment with CEFR levels while keeping stories engaging.

At a conceptual level, the pipeline looks like this:

1. Story drafting  
2. Language review and adjustment  
3. Audio generation  
4. Timing and alignment  
5. Presentation and distribution  

---

## 1. Story drafting

Stories are drafted with a specific CEFR level in mind.

Key considerations include:
- Target vocabulary range
- Intended grammar structures
- Story length appropriate to the level
- Clear narrative structure

Drafts are designed to be understandable without external references, relying on context and repetition.

---

## 2. Language review and adjustment

Drafts are reviewed to ensure they:
- Match the intended difficulty range
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Introduce new language gradually
- Maintain natural flow

This stage often involves small revisions rather than large rewrites, focusing on clarity and consistency.

---

## 3. Audio generation

Audio is a core part of the LinguaVerseSchool experience.

Stories are converted into spoken form with attention to:
- Clear pronunciation
- Natural pacing
- Sentence boundaries
- Consistency with the written text

The goal is for learners to be able to listen and read together without confusion.

---

## 4. Timing and alignment

To support reading-while-listening, audio is aligned with the text.

This enables:
- Sentence-level highlighting
- Accurate subtitles
- Predictable pacing

Alignment focuses on comprehension rather than technical precision. Minor timing variations are acceptable if they support readability.

---

## 5. Presentation and distribution

Stories are presented in formats that support different study habits, including:
- On-screen reading with audio
- Subtitles for listening practice
- Short video formats for passive exposure

Each format is derived from the same underlying story, ensuring consistency across platforms.

---

## Quality checks across the pipeline

At each stage, quality is evaluated with the learner experience in mind.

Checks include:
- Does the story still feel level-appropriate?
- Does the audio match the text exactly?
- Is the pacing comfortable for the target level?
- Is the story complete and coherent?

The aim is to avoid introducing friction that distracts from learning.

---

## Why the pipeline is modular

The pipeline is intentionally modular rather than monolithic.

This allows:
- Individual stages to be improved independently
- New formats to be added without rewriting content
- Consistency across languages and levels

Modularity supports experimentation while preserving a stable learner experience.

---

## What the pipeline does not attempt

The pipeline is not designed to:
- Automate learning entirely
- Replace speaking or interaction
- Maximise content volume at the expense of quality

Its role is to deliver **reliable, level-appropriate input** — a foundation that other learning activities can build on.

---

## Relationship to the difficulty model

The pipeline is guided by the conceptual difficulty model described earlier.

Difficulty considerations influence:
- Story drafting choices
- Review decisions
- Ordering of stories within a level

This ensures that progression remains smooth even as content formats evolve.

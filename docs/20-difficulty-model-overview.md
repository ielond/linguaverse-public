# Difficulty Model Overview (Conceptual)

Graded content only works if “difficulty” is estimated consistently.

LinguaVerseSchool uses a **conceptual difficulty model** to guide how stories are written, reviewed, and ordered within CEFR levels. This document explains the *principles* behind that model — not its internal implementation.

The aim is not mathematical precision, but **predictable learner experience**.

---

## What “difficulty” means in practice

Difficulty is often reduced to vocabulary alone. In reality, learners experience difficulty as a combination of multiple factors interacting at once.

LinguaVerseSchool treats difficulty as a **composite signal**, influenced by:

- Vocabulary familiarity
- Sentence structure
- Grammar usage
- Discourse structure
- Cognitive load

A story can be difficult even with simple words, and easy even with some unfamiliar vocabulary — depending on how these factors combine.

---

## Core components of difficulty

### 1. Vocabulary load

Vocabulary affects difficulty in several ways:
- Frequency of words
- Proportion of unfamiliar words
- Repetition across the text
- Transparency from context

Stories at lower levels prioritise high-frequency vocabulary and reuse it deliberately. New words are introduced gradually and reinforced through context rather than definition.

---

### 2. Sentence length and structure

Sentence complexity strongly affects readability.

Factors include:
- Average sentence length
- Number of clauses per sentence
- Use of coordination vs subordination
- Word order predictability

Lower-level stories favour short, linear sentences.  
Higher-level stories allow greater structural variety.

---

### 3. Grammar and tense usage

Grammar contributes to difficulty through:
- Variety of verb tenses
- Use of aspect and modality
- Agreement and inflection patterns
- Embedded or non-finite constructions

Stories are structured so that:
- Core tenses appear before peripheral ones
- Grammar builds cumulatively
- New structures appear in familiar contexts

---

### 4. Discourse and cohesion

Beyond sentences, learners must track meaning across the whole story.

This includes:
- Reference (pronouns, implicit subjects)
- Temporal sequencing
- Cause and effect
- Shifts in perspective or topic

Lower-level stories keep discourse simple and explicit.  
Higher-level stories gradually reduce redundancy and increase inference.

---

### 5. Cognitive load

Cognitive load is the total mental effort required to follow the story.

It is influenced by:
- Length of the text
- Density of new information
- Number of characters
- Abstractness of ideas
- Cultural assumptions

LinguaVerseSchool aims to keep cognitive load manageable so learners can focus on language, not decoding the situation.

---

## Difficulty as progression, not classification

Rather than asking:
> “What level is this story?”

LinguaVerseSchool asks:
> “Is this story slightly more challenging than the previous one?”

Stories are ordered to create **smooth progression within each CEFR level**, avoiding sudden jumps that discourage learners.

This allows learners to:
- Build confidence
- Notice improvement
- Transition naturally between levels

---

## Human review and iteration

While conceptual models guide consistency, difficulty is not decided automatically.

Stories are reviewed with questions such as:
- Can a learner at this level follow the main idea?
- Is new language supported by context?
- Does the story feel harder for the *right* reasons?

Learner feedback and usage patterns inform ongoing refinement.

---

## Why the model is intentionally opaque

LinguaVerseSchool does not publish exact scoring formulas, thresholds, or datasets.

This is intentional.

Difficulty estimation involves trade-offs, judgement, and iteration. Publishing raw formulas would not meaningfully help learners and could encourage misuse or oversimplification.

What matters is the outcome:
> Learners experience content that feels appropriately challenging and motivating.

---

## Relationship to CEFR

The difficulty model operates *within* the CEFR framework.

CEFR levels:
- Set expectations
- Define broad ability ranges
- Provide shared terminology

The difficulty model:
- Orders content within those ranges
- Smooths progression
- Reduces inconsistency between stories

Together, they support sustained learning.

# Quality Bar and Evaluation

LinguaVerseSchool prioritises **learning value over content volume**.

This document outlines the principles used to evaluate story quality and learner suitability. It does not describe internal metrics or tooling, but rather the *standards* content is expected to meet before being published.

---

## What “quality” means in this context

Quality is not defined by:
- Length
- Visual complexity
- Novelty
- Automation level

Instead, quality is judged by a simple question:

> Does this story help a learner at this level understand and enjoy the language more than before?

All evaluation criteria serve that goal.

---

## Core quality criteria

### 1. Level appropriateness

Each story should:
- Match its intended CEFR range
- Avoid unnecessary difficulty
- Introduce new language in a supported way

If a story feels harder than intended, it is revised or repositioned.

---

### 2. Comprehensibility

A learner at the target level should be able to:
- Follow the main narrative
- Identify who is doing what
- Understand cause and effect

Perfect comprehension is not required, but confusion should be limited and purposeful.

---

### 3. Linguistic consistency

Stories are evaluated for:
- Consistent tense usage
- Clear reference (pronouns, subjects)
- Predictable sentence structure at lower levels

Unexpected complexity is treated as a quality issue, not a feature.

---

### 4. Audio-text alignment

When audio is present:
- Spoken content should match the written text
- Pacing should suit the level
- Pronunciation should be clear and natural

Misalignment between audio and text undermines trust and learning effectiveness.

---

### 5. Completion experience

Stories are designed to be:
- Finishable in one sitting
- Narratively complete
- Satisfying rather than abrupt

Completion builds confidence and encourages continued learning.

---

## Evaluation is iterative

Quality evaluation is not a one-time gate.

Stories may be:
- Adjusted after review
- Reordered within a level
- Refined based on learner feedback

This iterative approach allows the platform to improve without disrupting learners.

---

## Avoiding artificial difficulty

Artificial difficulty includes:
- Rare vocabulary without support
- Long sentences used only to appear “advanced”
- Dense grammar introduced without context

These are avoided in favour of **natural progression**.

---

## Role of learner feedback

Learner feedback is used to:
- Identify stories that feel too easy or too hard
- Detect unclear sections
- Improve pacing and progression

Feedback complements, but does not replace, internal review.

---

## Quality over scale

LinguaVerseSchool does not aim to publish as much content as possible.

Instead, it aims to publish:
- Content learners return to
- Stories that feel trustworthy
- Material that supports long-term progress

A smaller set of high-quality stories is preferable to a large set of inconsistent ones.

---

## Summary

Quality at LinguaVerseSchool is defined by:
- Appropriateness
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Learner confidence

These principles guide all content decisions, regardless of language or level.

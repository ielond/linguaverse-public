# What is LinguaVerseSchool?

LinguaVerseSchool is an independent language-learning platform focused on **graded stories** aligned to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), from **A1 to C1**.

Its goal is simple:

> Help language learners read and listen to stories that are *actually* at their level — and progress smoothly over time.

This repository contains public documentation explaining the *method* and *design principles* behind LinguaVerseSchool. The production platform itself is proprietary and not included here.

## The problem LinguaVerseSchool addresses

Many language learners experience the same frustration:

- Beginner content feels artificial or repetitive  
- Intermediate content becomes suddenly too difficult  
- “CEFR-labelled” resources vary wildly in real difficulty  
- Native materials require constant stopping and translation  

The issue is rarely motivation or effort.  
It is **mismatched difficulty**.

Learning works best when learners understand *most* of what they read or hear, while still encountering a manageable amount of new material.

## What are graded stories?

Graded stories are short narratives written specifically for language learners.

A well-designed graded story:
- Uses vocabulary appropriate to a specific level
- Introduces grammar in a controlled way
- Is short enough to finish in one sitting
- Feels like a real story, not an exercise

The aim is **comprehension with momentum**, not perfect understanding.

LinguaVerseSchool uses graded stories as its core learning unit.

## Why CEFR alignment matters

The CEFR framework (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1) provides a shared reference for language ability across Europe and beyond.

However, simply labelling content “A2” or “B1” is not enough.

True CEFR alignment requires attention to:
- Vocabulary coverage
- Sentence length and structure
- Verb tense usage
- Clause complexity
- Predictability and repetition

LinguaVerseSchool treats CEFR levels as **ranges**, not hard boundaries, and designs content to progress gradually *within* each level.

## The LinguaVerseSchool approach

LinguaVerseSchool is built around a few core principles:

### 1. Narrow difficulty bands
Stories progress in small steps rather than large jumps.  
Learners should feel challenged, not overwhelmed.

### 2. Reading and listening together
Stories are designed to be read and listened to in parallel, reinforcing:
- Pronunciation
- Rhythm and pacing
- Spoken comprehension

### 3. Short, complete units
Each story is intended to be completed in a single session, supporting consistency and habit-building.

### 4. Context over memorisation
Vocabulary and grammar are introduced through repeated exposure in context, rather than isolated drills.

## Who LinguaVerseSchool is for

LinguaVerseSchool is especially suited to learners who:
- Study independently
- Want structured input without constant grammar explanation
- Are transitioning from beginner to intermediate levels
- Prefer learning through stories rather than exercises alone

It is designed to complement — not replace — other forms of study such as speaking practice or formal courses.

## What this repository is (and is not)

### This repository **is**:
- Public documentation of the LinguaVerseSchool method
- Explanations of design decisions and learning philosophy
- High-level descriptions of how content is structured and evaluated

### This repository **is not**:
- The LinguaVerseSchool production code
- A dataset of stories or vocabulary lists
- A reproducible implementation of the platform
- A commercial offering

All software, datasets, prompts, and production systems remain private.

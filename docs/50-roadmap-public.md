# Public Roadmap

This document outlines the **directional roadmap** for LinguaVerseSchool.

It is intentionally high-level. It describes *areas of focus* rather than specific features, timelines, or technical implementations. The aim is transparency, not commitment.

---

## Guiding principles

The roadmap is shaped by a few core principles:

- Learning value over feature volume
- Consistency over novelty
- Gradual improvement over disruptive change
- Sustainability over rapid expansion

Not all ideas listed here will be implemented, and priorities may change based on learner feedback.

---

## Near-term focus

### Expanding graded story libraries

The primary focus remains the creation of:
- High-quality graded stories
- Clear progression within CEFR levels
- Balanced coverage across topics and situations

Content growth is guided by quality standards rather than output targets.

---

### Improving progression clarity

Areas of ongoing attention include:
- Clearer signalling of difficulty within levels
- Better transitions between adjacent CEFR bands
- Helping learners understand *where they are* and *what comes next*

The goal is to reduce uncertainty and frustration.

---

### Refining audio-supported learning

Audio remains central to the LinguaVerseSchool approach.

Near-term improvements may include:
- More consistent pacing at lower levels
- Clearer alignment between text and audio
- Better support for listening-first study patterns

---

## Medium-term exploration

### Additional languages

LinguaVerseSchool is designed to support multiple languages.

Expansion is considered carefully, with attention to:
- Language-specific difficulty patterns
- Availability of suitable graded content
- Maintaining consistent quality standards

New languages are added only when the learning experience can meet the same bar as existing ones.

---

### Feedback-informed difficulty adjustment

Learner feedback is expected to play a larger role in:
- Identifying stories that feel misaligned
- Improving progression ordering
- Refining difficulty estimates over time

This complements internal review rather than replacing it.

---

### Alternative content formats

While graded stories remain central, related formats may be explored, such as:
- Thematic story collections
- Short listening-first narratives
- Lightweight review content built from existing stories

Any new format must support comprehension and progression, not distract from them.

---

## Longer-term ideas

### Personalised progression

Over time, LinguaVerseSchool may explore ways to:
- Adapt story ordering to learner behaviour
- Highlight content based on individual comfort levels
- Support different learning speeds

Any personalisation would prioritise transparency and learner control.

---

### Broader learning ecosystem

LinguaVerseSchool is intended to complement:
- Speaking practice
- Formal courses
- Other learning resources

Longer-term development may focus on making it easier to integrate LinguaVerseSchool into broader study routines without locking learners into a single path.

---

## What this roadmap is not

This roadmap is not:
- A feature promise
- A delivery schedule
- A guarantee of implementation

It exists to communicate **intent and direction**, not obligations.

---

## Ongoing evaluation

The roadmap is reviewed periodically and may change based on:
- Learner feedback
- Content quality considerations
- Sustainability constraints
- Evolving understanding of what best supports learning

---

## Closing note

LinguaVerseSchool aims to be:
- Reliable
- Understandable
- Respectful of learners’ time and effort

All roadmap decisions are evaluated against that goal.
